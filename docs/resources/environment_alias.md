# contentful_environment_alias (Resource)

An Environment Alias allows you to reference an environment with a static identifier.

## Important

Before using environment aliases, you must enable this feature in the Contentful web app. 

1. Navigate to **Settings > Environments** in your space and opt-in to environment aliases.
2. During this process, a default `master` alias will be created automatically.
3. Use the import command below to import the `master` alias into your Terraform state.

Only space administrators can enable and manage environment aliases. See the [Contentful Environment Aliases documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/environment-aliases) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "contentful_environment_alias" "master" {
  space_id       = "space-id"
  alias_id       = "master" # You must have at least one called master
  environment_id = "environment-id"
}
```
